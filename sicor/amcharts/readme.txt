*********************************************************************************
Flash version of amCharts is not being developed further.
You might want to check JavaScript version of amCharts which is more advanced,
doesn't require plug-in and can be viewed on iPad and all modern browsers.
*********************************************************************************
In this package you will find a fallback mechanism which loads and parse data
and settings of flash charts and creates JavaScript version as close to flash
as it is possible. This might be a good solution if you already have a lot of 
flash charts and don't want to learn JS version. However you might miss a lot
of new features offered by JS version.
